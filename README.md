# 🌟 Face Recognition and Detection Project using OpenCV

This project demonstrates two exciting functionalities:

1. **📸 Real-Time Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed.
2. **🧑‍🎨 Face Recognition**: Recognizes faces using a pre-trained Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) model, trained on a given dataset of faces.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎯 Face Detection
- Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
- Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces.

### 🔍 Face Recognition
- Identifies faces from the given dataset.
- Trained using OpenCV's LBPH face recognizer.
- Outputs the recognized person's name and confidence score.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soham1411/face_reognition_opencv.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd face_recognition_codes
   cd face_detection_codes
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### 📹 Real-Time Face Detection

1. Ensure the `haar_face.xml` file is in the project directory.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python face_detect1.py
   ```
3. Press `q` to exit the real-time detection window.

### 🖼 Face Recognition

1. Place the training dataset in the `faces/` directory.
2. Train the recognizer (script provided):
   ```bash
   python face_train.py
   ```
3. Run the recognition script:
   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
   ```
